# Testing

## Summary

- this is where we implement unit tests
- we are using the testing framework ```pytest```
- there should be one unit testing class for every class implemented in the project
- if your class is named "FruitAnalyzer" your unit test class should be named "TestFruitAnalyzer"
- if your fruit analyzer class is defined in the file "fruit_analyzer.py" then your unit test class should be implemented in a file named "test_fruit_analyzer.py"
